Graceful degradation and service workers are related since service workers enable apps that normally would require medium or high internet speeds and connections to still perform decently 
even with slow internet speeds. This is because the service worker can help cache previous network requests, so those with slow internet speeds only need to retrieve the data once 
and can reference the cache with every subsequent fetch request. This reduces the amount of buffering and load on the user's end, making their experience smoother. 
Thus, the app is gracefully degradated since the app is built with max technology but there are safeguards for users who may have slower internet speeds such that their experience is still decent.
